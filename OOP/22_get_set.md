We can use setter methods to set values to the instance variables. These setter
methods are also known as mutator method...

```py
# Syntax
def set_variable_name(self, variable):
	self.variable = variable
```

```py
def set_marks(self, mark):
	self.mark = mark
```

## Getter Method

We can use getter methods to get values to the instance variables. These getter
methods are also known as accessor method...

```py
# Syntax
def get_variable_name(self):
	return self.variable
```

```py
def get_marks(self):
	return self.mark
```
