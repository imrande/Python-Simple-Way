# Instance vs Class vs Static method

- if we're using only instance variables --> instance method
- if we're using instance variables and class variables --> instance method
- if we're using only class variables --> class method
- if we're using instance variables and local variables --> instance method
- if we're using class variables and local variables --> class method
- if we're using local variables --> static method

for delcare class method decorator `@classmethod` is required and it's compulsory...
for delcare static method decorator `@staticmethod` is required but not compulsory...

Without any decorator if we are calling method by className then it will be treated as static method... if we are calling method by obj ref then it will be treated as instance method.

```py
# static method
class Test:
    def m1():
        print('some method')
        
t = Test()
Test.m1() 
```

```py
# instance method
class Test:
    def m1(x):
        print('some method')
        
t = Test()
t.m1()
````
