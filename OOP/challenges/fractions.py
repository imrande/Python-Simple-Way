"""
Write a class definition for the following scenario -->
You have to write a class called MyFraction which works on fractions of the
form a/b where a represents the numerator and b represents the denominator. Both a and b are integers (i.e. if a = 1
and b = 2, then the fraction will be 1/2). Your class should perform the following operations:
i. Create two constructors â€“ (1) with no parameters that set a = 0 and b = 1;
and (2) with 2 integer parameters that sets both a and b.
ii. Write an instance method for addition which returns the resultant object.
[int: a/b + c/d = (ad + bc)/bd]
iii. Write a static method for multiplication which returns the resultant object.
[Hint a/b * c/d = ac/bd]
iv. Write a main() that allocates two Fractions, 1/2 and 3/4 and stores
their sum in a third variable.
