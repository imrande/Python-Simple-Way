```py
class Student:
	...

student1 = Student()
```

Class is a blueprint / template / plan to create objects.
class contains properties(variables) and methods(functions).

object is a physical existence of a class, instance of a class.
we can create any number of objects for a class.
in the above example, `Student()` is an object.

The variable which can be used to refer object is called reference variable.
By using reference variable, we can perform required operations and can access properties and methods of an object.
we can set any num of ref variables for each object.
in the above example, `student1` is a reference variable.
